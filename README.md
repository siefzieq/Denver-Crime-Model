# 🚨 Denver Crime Severity Classification Model
This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify crime reports from the Denver Crime Dataset into severity categories: low, medium, and high. Using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression, I developed robust classification models to uncover patterns in crime severity.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview:
Size: 400,000 records
Features: 20 features capturing various crime attributes
Tools: Implemented with scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, and matplotlib for visualizing results.

## ⚙️ Model Development:
I utilized three different machine learning algorithms:<br>

🌲 Random Forest <br>
👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) <br>
📉 Logistic Regression <br>

Each model was fine-tuned for performance, using metrics like:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score

## 📊 Results & Insights:
The results were evaluated and visualized, providing valuable insights into crime severity patterns in Denver. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in machine learning but also showcases the ability to work with large datasets and apply supervised learning techniques effectively.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies:
1. Scikit-Learn for model implementation
2. Matplotlib for data visualization
3. Pandas for data manipulation
4. Supervised Learning techniques
5. Anaconda environment for efficient workflow
